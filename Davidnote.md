# David's notes

Projects: folder per team/lab group

Shared is assets used for different projects



.yaml is the manifest (css_lab/ct_topic/ct_topic.treatments.yaml — 70 different treatments)



Look at constructive_disagreement, super_sabbatical_wbl — that’s an easier one



.json file sets up the study you run.

“launchDate”: immediate, then people get matched at any time.



centralPrereg: true -> everything you submitted to the central database. So set to false for pilot (and maybe in general)



“Treatments”: sometimes, you only want to run a subset of possible treatments.



Treatment is for each pairing (e.g., persuader_pro_incentive__receiver_con, persuader_con_incentive__receiver_pro, etc.)





Everyone gets same instructions until they are in the synchronous stage.



All the group randomization happens AFTER the intro survey. Everyone gets same preserved, then they are matched, then they are assigned to roles.



Max they have tried is 200 simultaneous, but probably can handle more.
