# Discussion instructions

In a moment, you will join a discussion with two other participants, where you will discuss three topics related to the questions you just answered. One of you will be assigned the group's leader, and will start the discussion off for each topic, and then the group as a whole will have a chance to discuss.

A progress bar will count down the time for each segment of your discussion, and a bell will chime when it is time to move on to the next segment.
