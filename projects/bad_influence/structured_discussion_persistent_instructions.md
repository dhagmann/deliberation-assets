# Discussion Instructions

In this discussion session you'll discuss 3 specific topics in turn. The first topic will appear in 30 seconds.

You will spend 3 minutes on each topic. When a topic appears, the group leader should describe their views on the topic for 30 seconds, and then the group should discuss freely for the remaining time. After a total of 3 minutes, a new topic will appear, and you'll repeat this process.
