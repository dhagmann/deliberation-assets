# Task Description

You will see a series of images like the one below.

![example_image](projects/css_lab/ct_topic_control/images/example.jpg)

For each image, **write a detailed description of as many items as you can see**. Think of this as inventorying the scene: what objects are present, what materials or colors they have, and how they are arranged. Here's an example response:

> A white countertop island with a built-in sink and a stainless steel dishwasher.
> A pair of orange rubber gloves hangs from a drawer handle beneath the sink.
> On the counter are a dish rack, soap dispenser and sponge.
> The back counter has a toaster, a phone, a cup of pens/pencils, and a box of tissues.
> The cabinets are wood with metal handles. One has a piece of paper on it.
> There is a white refrigerator.
> Behind the sink is a round, white table, with blue and green wooden chairs around it, and a hanging lamp above.
> There are framed pictures on the walls.
> An open doorway leads to a room beyond, which has green walls.
> The ceiling trim has chilli peppers on it.

- Youâ€™ll have 10 minutes total to work through the images.
- You wonâ€™t get through all of the images, and thatâ€™s perfectly fine.
- What matters most is that you **take your time and write thorough, thoughtful descriptions** for each one you do see.

ðŸ‘‰ Please stay focused on the task throughout the full 10 minutesâ€”donâ€™t switch to other tabs or take breaks.
