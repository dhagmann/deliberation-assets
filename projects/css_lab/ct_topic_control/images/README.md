These images are drawn from the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset ("Common Objects in Context"). Each image depicts everyday scenes featuring familiar household or daily-use items, without any people or animals present. All images are in landscape orientation and were selected to reflect ordinary environments that most viewers will find easily recognizable. The scenes are rich in identifiable objects, have neutral emotional valence, and were selected to avoid signaling specific values, social class, or group identity. The goal is to present mundane, relatable settings that do not evoke strong feelings or associations.
