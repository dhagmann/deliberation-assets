# The game you are about to play has two stages:

## Stage 1: Discussion and labeling (Video Call)

In the first stage, your group will be shown a set of eight images, such as the ones blurred out below.

You will have 10 minutes to come up with unique labels for each image, and enter them in the shared document that follows.

You will need to remember each label exactly, and so labels should be memorable, short, and _distinct_ from one another.

## Stage 2: Recall (On your own)

After your discussion, we will show you images one at a time, and ask you to type the label your group decided on for that image.

If everyone's enters the correct label for the image, you will earn 10 points. If anyone writes the label incorrectly, you earn no points.

### You will play four rounds of labeling and recall, with different images in each round.
