# The game you are about to play has two stages:

# Stage 1: Discussion and Labeling (Video Call) 👤👤👤

Your group will see a set of eight images, like the ones blurred below.

Together, come up with **unique** labels for each image and enter them into the shared text box.  
**You must fill out a label for every image in each round.**

💡 Make your labels short, memorable, and _distinct_ from one another — you’ll need to recall them exactly later.

⚠️ **Please don’t take screenshots.** This is a memory game designed to be fun — using screenshots takes away the challenge.

# Stage 2: Recall (On Your Own) 👤

After your group discussion, you’ll see the images again, one at a time.

⚠️ You **won't see numbers on the images** during the recall stage

Type the label your group agreed on for each image.

- If **everyone** enters the correct label, your group earns **10 points**.
- If **anyone** gets it wrong, no points are awarded.

### You will play four rounds of labeling and recall, with different images in each round.

### You will play four rounds, each with a new set of images.

- **Round 1:** 5 minutes to discuss
- **Round 2:** 3 minutes
- **Rounds 3 & 4:** 90 seconds each

You **may reuse labels across rounds**, but **not within the same round**.
