A simple survey to collect inflation forecast and information sources. It also includes a pair-up text chat between two participants to discuss their forecasts.

## Intro stage

[add hint: 10% inflation means that a coffee that cost $5 now will cost $5.5 in July 2026.]

-- consider using multiple choice to group the users for pair-up exercise later
e.g. 
1) <0%
2) 0%-5%
3) >5%

Please indicate all information sources that help you to form inflation forecasts:
multiple choices
1) grocery price
2) gas price
