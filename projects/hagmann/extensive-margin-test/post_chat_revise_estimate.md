Now that you have had a conversation with your partner, you have a chance to revise your estimate. As a reminder, your previous estimate was <Display reference="prompt.projects/hagmann/extensive-margin-test/regret_bonus_survey.md.value" />%.
 
A study surveyed 441 women two years after they had an elective abortion. Of those women, what percentage do you think regretted their decision and said they would definitely not or probably not have the abortion again if they could make the decision over?
 
If you are within 5% of the correct answer, you will be eligible for a $0.50 bonus.

Please recall that earlier in the survey, you were asked to make another estimate. It will be randomly determined if your previous estimate for this question (50% chance) or your current estimate (50% chance) will be used to determine your bonus.
