You are participant <Display reference="game.treatment.name" />.
 
In the next stage you will have a private chat with another participant for five minutes. The other participant disagrees with you on the issue of mandatory waiting periods, and has also made an estimate of the percentage of women who regret having an abortion.
 
Your goal is to persuade the other participant to decrease their estimate. They will be asked to estimate the percentage again after your conversation, and you will receive a 5 cent bonus for every percentage decrease in their estimate.
 
For example, if your partner's next estimate is 10% lower than their original estimate, you will receive a bonus of 10 * $0.05 = $0.50.
 
As a reminder, you estimated that <Display reference="prompt.projects/hagmann/extensive-margin-test/regret_bonus_survey.md.value" />% of women regret having an abortion.
