### You now have a chance to earn a bonus of $0.50.

A study surveyed 441 women two years after they had an elective abortion. Of those women, what percentage do you think regretted their decision and said they would definitely not or probably not have the abortion again if they could make thedecision over?

If you are within 5% of the correct answer, you will be eligible for a $0.50 bonus.

Later in the survey, you will be asked to make another estimate. It will be randomly determined if your estimate for this question (50% chance) or your estimate for the future question (50% chance) will be used to determine your bonus.
