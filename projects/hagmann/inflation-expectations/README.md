# Inflation Expectations Experiment

## Overview

This experiment studies how people form inflation expectations and how these expectations change through social discussion. Participants are asked to forecast inflation rates, discuss their reasoning with a partner, and then have the opportunity to revise their forecasts.

## Experiment Design

### Stage 1: Initial Forecast
- Participants provide their inflation forecast for the next 12 months
- Multiple choice options: <0%, 0-2%, 2-5%, 5-10%, >10%
- Includes explanation of inflation with concrete examples

### Stage 2: Information Sources
- Participants indicate what sources they use to form inflation expectations
- Multiple select options including: grocery prices, gas prices, rental prices, wage changes, news/media, personal experiences, economic data, other

### Stage 3: Discussion
- Participants are paired for a 5-minute text chat
- They discuss their inflation forecasts and reasoning
- Guidelines encourage respectful, constructive conversation

### Stage 4: Revision
- Participants indicate if their forecast changed after discussion
- Options: increased, decreased, or remained the same
- Open response question asking for detailed explanation of reasoning

### Stage 5: Demographics
- Age group, education level, economic familiarity
- Used for analysis of how different groups form expectations

## Research Questions

1. How do people form inflation expectations?
2. What information sources do they rely on?
3. How do social discussions influence inflation forecasts?
4. What factors lead to forecast revisions?
5. How do demographic characteristics relate to inflation expectations?
