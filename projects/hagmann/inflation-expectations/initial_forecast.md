# Your Inflation Forecast

## What is inflation?
Inflation measures how much the general level of prices for goods and services increases over time. When inflation occurs, your money buys fewer goods and services than it did before.

## Example:
- If inflation is 10% per year, a coffee that costs $5.00 today will cost $5.50 in one year
- If inflation is 2% per year, the same coffee will cost $5.10 in one year

## Your task:
Please provide your forecast for the inflation rate over the next 12 months (from now until July 2026).

Think about:
- Recent changes in prices you've observed (groceries, gas, rent, etc.)
- News about the economy
- Your personal experiences with price changes
- Any economic data or reports you may have seen

**What do you expect the inflation rate to be over the next 12 months?**

Please select the range that best matches your expectation:

---

- Less than 0% (deflation)
- 0% to 2%
- 2% to 5%
- 5% to 10%
- More than 10%
