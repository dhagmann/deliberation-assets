# After the Discussion

## Thank you for participating in the discussion!

You've just had a conversation with another participant about inflation expectations. Now we'd like to know if this discussion influenced your thinking.

## Has your inflation forecast changed?

Think about:
- Did your partner share information or perspectives you hadn't considered?
- Did the discussion make you think differently about factors that influence inflation?
- Did hearing someone else's reasoning affect your own expectations?
- Did the conversation confirm or challenge your initial beliefs?

**Please indicate whether your inflation forecast has changed after the discussion:**

Remember: There are no "right" answers. We're interested in whether and how the discussion influenced your thinking about inflation.
