# Explaining Your Decision

## Please explain your reasoning

Whether you changed your forecast or kept it the same, we'd like to understand your thinking process.

### If you changed your forecast:
- What specific aspects of the discussion influenced your thinking?
- What new information or perspectives did your partner share?
- How did hearing someone else's reasoning affect your own?
- What factors did you reconsider after the discussion?

### If you kept your forecast the same:
- Why did the discussion not change your expectations?
- Did you find your partner's reasoning unconvincing?
- Did the discussion confirm your initial beliefs?
- Were there aspects of the discussion you disagreed with?

### General reflection:
- What did you learn from the discussion?
- How did hearing another person's perspective affect your thinking?
- What aspects of inflation expectations do you think people might disagree about?
