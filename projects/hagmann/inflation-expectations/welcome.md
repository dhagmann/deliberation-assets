# Welcome to the Inflation Expectations Study

Thank you for participating in this research study about inflation expectations!

## What to expect:
1. You will be asked to provide your forecast for inflation over the next 12 months
2. You will indicate what information sources you use to form your inflation expectations
3. You will be paired with another participant for a brief discussion about inflation
4. After the discussion, you'll have the opportunity to revise your forecast
5. Finally, you'll answer some demographic questions

## What is inflation?
Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising. For example, if inflation is 10%, a coffee that costs $5 now will cost $5.50 in one year.

## Discussion format:
- You will have a 5-minute text chat with your partner
- You can discuss your inflation expectations and the reasons behind them
- Be respectful and constructive in your conversation

The study will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.
