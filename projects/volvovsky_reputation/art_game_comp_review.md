## Review Art Game Instructions

_At the beginning of the round, the collector decides whether to pay the agent **50 points** from their current earnings to purchase a piece of art, or to end the game._

_If the collector hires the agent, they send them a text message with a description of the piece._

_When the agent arrives at the gallery, they realize they left their phone (with the collector's message) at home. They may either:_

- _Spend **30 points** from the 50 they got paid to take a cab home, retrieve the phone, and return to the gallery before it closes_
- _Buy a piece of art without seeing the message_

_The **collector pays the agent regardless of what the agent decides to do**._

_If the agent purchases the correct piece, the collector earns **80 points**._

_If the agent buys the wrong piece, the collector earns nothing, and loses the **50 points** they paid the agent._

_At the end of the round, the collector may choose to hire the same agent to buy another piece of art, or end the game._

👉 _The collector doesn't know that the agent forgot their phone, only whether they purchased the correct piece of art._

_100 points is worth $2.00_
