# Game 1: The Labeling Game!

This game has two stages:

## Stage 1: Label Images

- Video call with two other participants 👤👤👤
- As a group, decide names for 8 different images

👉 Pick names that are **memorable** and **unique**

## Stage 2: Remember Your Labels

- Work separately 👤 | 👤 | 👤
- Over 8 rounds, we'll show you each image from Stage 1 and ask you to type in the name your group gave that image
- If everyone enters **the exact same name** for the image, you earn **25 points** for each image
- If one of you forgets the name, nobody will get any points for that image
