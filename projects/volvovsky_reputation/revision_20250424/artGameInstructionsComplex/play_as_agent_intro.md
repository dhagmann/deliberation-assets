## Training round 2: Play as Agent

In this phase, you are playing as the **agent** in the Art Buying Game.

_This is a training round, so the collector will be played by a bot:_

A wealthy art collector has paid you **40 points** to purchase a piece of art from the set below, and has given you the money to buy it.

They described the piece they want in a text message, but unfortunately you left your phone at home, so you can't read the message.

The gallery closes soon, and the only way you can read the message in time is to **pay 20 points** from what the collector paid you, to get a taxi home and back.

Or, you can keep those 20 points, and buy whichever art piece you guess the collector wants.

👉 If you get the right piece, this collector may want to hire you again in the future.

100 Points is worth $2.00

**Are you going to pay 20 points to take a taxi home to get your phone?**
