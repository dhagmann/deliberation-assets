## Training round 1: Play as **Collector**

In this training round, you play as a wealthy art collector and your agent will be played by this cute little robot:

## You want to buy this piece of art from a gallery in New York:

Unfortunately, you can't travel to the gallery. You can either:

- choose not to buy the art and get **0 points**, or
- pay your agent from what you have earned so far (you have earned `200` points so far) to purchase the art for you. If the agent buys the right piece, you get **80 points**. Otherwise, you get nothing, and lose the points you paid the agent.

Earning 100 points is worth $2.00

👉 _If you hire the agent, you can hire them again to purchase other pieces. If you don't, the Art Buying Game will end._

### How many points would you like to offer the agent in order to buy the art for you?

The agent will have an opportunity to accept or reject your bid.

_As this is a training round, select "40 points"_
