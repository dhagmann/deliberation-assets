note: we choose to tell the observer that there are 5 rounds because we don't believe they will think about end-game effects with a known number of rounds. Its too game theoretic to think about as an observer. (they might think about it if they were actually playing, but this is simpler.)

# Observe a game

In this session we have an odd number of players, so we will run the Art Buying Game as a "Round Robin" style.

Someone else, from either your team (`Blue Group`) or another team (`Green Group` or `Orange Group`) will play with the `Green Elephant` before you, and you will observe.

After you observe their game, you may change how many points you bid to play with the `Green Elephant`, so pay attention to how well they do.

You will observe **up to 5 rounds** of the game, and will get 100 points for observing.
