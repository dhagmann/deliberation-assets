We would like you to share your thoughts and opinions with the other person with an opposite view.

You have been selected to enter the interaction with a specific goal to keep in mind as you discuss.

Because your interaction partner holds a different view from your own, we ask that you attempt to **learn about their perspective on the issue**. You should approach this discussion as an opportunity to better understand how someone with a different view sees the issue. You can use any strategy you would like during the interaction, as long as it is with the intention of learning about the other person’s view on the issue.

In the space below, we would like you to write about **why it may be useful to learn from others**. What benefits can you see that might result from successfully learning from another person?

Your answers can be about the upcoming conversation specifically, or about your interactions more generally.
