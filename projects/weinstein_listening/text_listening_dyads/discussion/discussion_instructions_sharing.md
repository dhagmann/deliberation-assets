Please do your best to try to **EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS** to them.

Whether or not you agree please make a great effort to demonstrate you have meaningful views that you can share, you have a useful perspective, and you value your views.

As a reminder, you can insert emojis using your computer’s built-in keyboard shortcuts or emoji panel during the conversation.
For example:
• On Windows: Windows + . (period)
• On Mac: Command + Control + Space
