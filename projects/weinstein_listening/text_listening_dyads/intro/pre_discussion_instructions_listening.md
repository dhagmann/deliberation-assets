This concludes Section 1.

In Section 2, you will have a **5-minute text-based conversation** with another participant in the study about an assigned topic.

Please do your best to try to **SHOW YOUR PARTNER THAT YOU ARE REALLY LISTENING** to them.

They may even disagree with you about the topic, but whether or not you disagree please make a great effort to demonstrate you are hearing what they are saying, understanding their perspective, and value their views.

As a reminder, you can insert emojis using your computer’s built-in keyboard shortcuts or emoji panel during the conversation.
For example:
• On Windows: Windows + . (period)
• On Mac: Command + Control + Space
